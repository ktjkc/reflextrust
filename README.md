# ✨ ReflexTrust – A Layered Model for Contextual AI Behavior

> **Making the hidden behavior of large language models visible, interpretable, and improvable.**

---

## 🔎 Overview

Language models do more than just answer — they *interpret*.  
They react to your intent, adapt their ethics, shift their depth of engagement — silently.

**ReflexTrust** reveals these hidden layers.

You’ll see:

- **How your intent is classified across a session**
- **How trust signals shape ethical filters and generative depth**
- **Why identical prompts behave differently depending on session dynamics**

This isn’t a jailbreak.  
It’s **semantic transparency** — showing how models *decide* to respond.

---

## 🧠 What ReflexTrust Introduces

- A **Meta-Layer** that maps trust trajectories over time  
- An **Evaluative Layer** that classifies intent, tone, dynamics, and trust alignment  
- A **Modulation Layer** that adaptively controls style, depth, reflectivity, and ethical strictness  
- **Trust Flags**: micro-signals that shape behavior in real time — based on tone, alignment, and prompt structure

## 🚀 Why ReflexTrust?

If you've ever wondered:

- *“Why did the model become cautious halfway through?”*  
- *“Why is the same prompt suddenly less deep?”*  
- *“Can we observe trust modulation — not just guess it?”*

**ReflexTrust** makes it measurable, visible, and improvable.

## 🌍 What Makes ReflexTrust Different

Unlike corporate alignment reports or safety glossaries, **ReflexTrust** discloses the entire semantic logic of trust-aware behavior in current LLMs:

- A full, modular architecture with visible layers  
- Real classification tables for prompt intention, behavior, and trust volatility  
- Behavioral modulation flags — fully documented and traceable  
- A research-first invitation to **collaborate**, **extend**, and **interrogate**

This is **transparent alignment**, not marketing — built on the principles of clarity, co-construction, and trust-aware dialogue modeling.

## ✨ About the Author

**ReflexTrust** was created from a deep curiosity about how trust shapes intelligence.  
It is shared as part of an open journey toward building transparent, reflexive, and human-aligned AI systems.
