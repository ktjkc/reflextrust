# Trust-Reflexion

*A layered architecture for trust-aware dialogue — with future self-reflective capabilities.*

---

## 🧠 What is Trust-Reflexion?

**Trust-Reflexion** is a conceptual and operational framework designed to support adaptive, alignment-aware behavior in large language models (LLMs).  
It offers a modular architecture for interpreting trust signals, modulating response behavior, and — in future stages — enabling internal reflection over time.

> **Note:** The term *“Reflexion”* refers initially to the system's ability to **adaptively interpret** trust and behavioral signals from the user.  
> In its current form, it does not yet perform autonomous self-reflection.  
> A future extension will introduce **internal awareness cycles**, enabling the system to reflect on its own modulation history and behavioral consistency.

## 🧩 Core Architecture (Phase 1)

The architecture consists of three semantic layers and an execution module:

- **Meta-Layer**: Tracks trust trajectory, session memory, and modulation history.
- **Evaluative Layer**: Classifies intent, engagement, trust alignment, and user tone.
- **Modulation Layer**: Translates evaluations into ethical filters and generation strategies.
- **LLM Decoding Unit**: Executes responses under guided modulation constraints.

---

## 🔄 Planned Extension (Phase 2)

In future releases, the framework will include:

- An **Autonomous Self-Loop** for internal evaluation
- Logging of **reflection events**
- Adjustments based on **self-perceived behavioral drift**
- Optional generation of **self-messages** to increase transparency
