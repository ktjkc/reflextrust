## 🤖 What is ReflexTrust?

ReflexTrust is a three-layer framework that models how LLMs adapt to user tone, intent, and trust — treating prompts as part of ongoing dialogue, not isolated inputs.

It provides:
- **Interpretability** through layered trust modeling  
- **Adaptivity** via reflex signals and modulation logic  
- **Evaluation** with trust-sensitive test cards

### ⚡ Motivation

LLMs don’t just process text — they read the room.

Most frameworks act like every prompt lives in a vacuum. 
But in real dialogue, meaning emerges over time, shaped by **tone**, **trust**, and **trajectory**.

> 🧠 **The Problem**:  
> Current models adapt — but invisibly.  
> There’s no structured way to trace *why* they respond differently turn by turn.

**ReflexTrust** changes that.  
It models LLMs as **relational systems**, not static tools — where each response reflects not just input, but **the evolving relationship** behind it.

> Trust isn’t a filter — it’s the frame.  
> Depth, restraint, empathy: all modulated by trust over time.

### 🧬 **Most models react to text.**  
ReflexTrust reacts to **context**.

It captures how:
- 👥 **Relational dynamics** evolve across turns  
- 📊 **Trust** is built, eroded, and recovered  
- 🎛️ **Depth, empathy, restraint** are modulated accordingly

## 🧱 Layered Architecture

| Layer       | Role                    | Key Functions                            |
|-------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| Echo        | Tracks session-wide trust | Continuity, volatility detection         |
| Evaluative  | Interprets input        | Intent, tone, reflex signal classification |
| Modulation  | Shapes response behavior | Ethics, depth, restraint flags           |

> 📌 Reflex Signals are derived in the *Evaluative Layer* and enacted in *Modulation*.
