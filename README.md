# STRATA: Structured Trust Architecture for Transparent Alignment

*A modular, trust-modulated framework for context-aware LLMs — with future reflexive extensions.*

---

## 🧠 What is STRATA?

**STRATA** is a structured trust-modulation framework for large language models (LLMs).  
It formalizes how trust signals, user intent, and system behavior interact across dialogue sessions.

> **Note:** STRATA Phase 1 enables context-aware, ethically guided generation by evaluating user behavior and intent across turns.  
> In future expansions — internally codenamed **Trust-Reflexion** — STRATA may support **self-reflective modulation**, allowing models to track and revise their own behavioral history.

## 🧩 Core Architecture (Phase 1)

**STRATA** consists of three interdependent layers:

- **Meta-Layer**: Tracks session-wide trust evolution via:
  - Trust Continuity
  - Trust Scoring
  - Session Continuity Engine
  - Session Metadata

- **Evaluative Layer**: Classifies five key dimensions of user input:
  - Prompt Intention
  - Response Behaviour
  - Response Dynamics
  - Engagement Feedback
  - Trust Alignment

- **Modulation Layer (with LLM Execution Unit)**:  
  Translates evaluations into generation control, including:
  - Ethical Modulation
  - Generative Depth
  - Response Simulation
  - Self-Reflection Trigger (planned)
  - Final output execution

## 🔄 Phase Transition

- **Phase 1 (STRATA)**: Reactive, trust-sensitive modulation based on session signals
- **Phase 2 (Trust-Reflexion)**: Reflexive behavior tracking, internal consistency modeling, and meta-cognitive modulation

See [`design/strata-roadmap.md`](design/strata-roadmap.md) for an overview of future development.
