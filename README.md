# 🚀 Structured Trust Architecture for Transparent Alignment (STRATA)

*A next-generation trust-modulated framework that exposes the hidden logic behind LLM behaviour.*

---

## 🧠 What’s this all about?

Large language models don’t just answer — they assess.  
They react to your intent, shift tone mid-dialogue, modulate ethics, and decide how deep to go… but until now, all of that was invisible.

This framework lifts the veil.

It reveals:

- How your intent is evaluated across turns  
- How trust signals shape ethical filtering and response depth  
- Why the exact same prompt can yield wildly different replies in different moments  

No more prompt superstition. No more mystery.  
This is **transparent alignment** in action — not a jailbreak, not a hack, but a structured decoding of the model’s own behavior.

> Phase 1 introduces the core 3-layer architecture.  
> Phase 2 will add **self-reflective modulation** — where the system tracks and adjusts its own decisions across sessions.

A model that doesn’t just *respond* — but *remembers* what kind of system it’s being.

Explore the full framework and see how trust-aware behavior makes LLMs feel *less like machines — and more like mirrors*.

## 🧩 3 Core Layers

- **Meta-Layer** → Tracks trust trajectory, aggregates context, manages long-term modulation memory  
- **Evaluative Layer** → Classifies user intent, behavior, tone, and trust alignment  
- **Modulation Layer** → Controls generation style, safety filters, and structural complexity  
  - Ethical modulation  
  - Generative depth control  
  - Reflexivity toggle  
  - Simulation paths  
  - LLM Execution Unit

## 💬 Why It Matters

STRATA is for anyone who’s ever asked:
> “Why did the model suddenly go vague?”  
> “Why was it so reflective last time — and now it's bland?”  
> “Can we *measure* trust, not just guess it?”

We’re building the answer.

## 🤝 Collaborate With Us

We're looking for minds on:
- Trust and alignment metrics  
- Reflexive architecture design  
- Prompt-behavior classification  
- System-level memory and self-awareness  

DMs open. Demos brewing. Let’s modulate trust, together.
