# Trust-Reflexion

*A layered architecture for trust-aware dialogue — with future self-reflective capabilities.*

---

## 🧠 What is Trust-Reflexion?

**Trust-Reflexion** is a conceptual and operational framework designed to support adaptive, alignment-aware behavior in large language models (LLMs).  
It offers a modular architecture for interpreting trust signals, modulating response behavior, and — in future stages — enabling internal reflection over time.

> **Note:** The term *“Reflexion”* refers initially to the system's ability to **adaptively interpret** trust and behavioral signals from the user.  
> In its current form (Phase 1), it does not yet perform autonomous self-reflection.  
> Phase 2 introduces **internal awareness cycles**, enabling the system to reflect on its own modulation history and behavioral consistency.

## 🧩 Architecture Layers

- **Meta-Layer**: Supervises trust trajectory, session memory, and modulation history.
- **Evaluative Layer**: Classifies intent, engagement, trust alignment, and user tone.
- **Modulation Layer (incl. LLM Execution Unit)**: Translates evaluations into generation strategies and directly executes output under control of modulation flags:
  - Ethical filters
  - Generative depth
  - Simulation triggers
  - Self-reflection enabling

## 🔄 Phase Transition

- **Phase 1:** Trust-Modulated Core (reactive, aligned, but not reflective)
- **Phase 2:** Reflexive Self-Awareness (autonomous self-monitoring and behavioral feedback)
