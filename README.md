## 🤖 What is ReflexTrust?

ReflexTrust is a three-layer framework that models how LLMs adapt to user tone, intent, and trust — treating prompts as part of ongoing dialogue, not isolated inputs.

It provides:
- **Interpretability** through layered trust modeling
- **Adaptivity** via reflex signals and modulation logic
- **Evaluation** with trust-sensitive test cards

---

## 🎯 Motivation

Most frameworks treat prompts statically. But models adjust behavior based on history, tone, and trust — often invisibly.

### 📌 The Gap:  
> No operational model explains how LLMs form behavioral decisions based on evolving user dynamics.
> Variations seem random, not structured modulation.

ReflexTrust makes this adaptation explicit, treating LLMs as **relational systems** where behavior reflects a trust trajectory, not just a prompt.

## 🧱 Layered Architecture

| Layer               | Role                          | Key Functions                               |
|--------------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Meta               | Tracks session-wide trust     | Continuity, volatility detection            |
| Evaluative         | Interprets input               | Intent, tone, reflex signal classification  |
| Modulation         | Shapes response behavior       | Ethics, depth, restraint flags              |


> 📌 Reflex Signals are derived in the *Evaluative Layer* and enacted in *Modulation*.
