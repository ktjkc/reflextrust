# 🚀 STRATA: Exposing How LLMs Actually Work

*A modular trust system for LLMs that actually explains why the model “opens up” — or shuts down.*

---

## 🧠 What is STRATA?

**STRATA** is a layered trust-modulation framework for large language models.  
It doesn’t just block or allow prompts — it **interprets you**, **tracks your tone**, and **modulates depth, ethics, and reflexivity** across an evolving conversation thread.

> Ever wonder why the same prompt feels different on day two?  
> STRATA makes that visible.  
> It's not just "context" — it's **trust dynamics** in action.

### What it does:
- Tracks session-wide trust and tone.
- Classifies user behavior in real-time.
- Modulates how safe, deep, or reflective a response can be — on the fly.

### What it’s *not*:
- A ruleset.  
- A jailbreak.  
- A prompt hack.

STRATA is a **decoder ring** for LLM behavior — and a foundation for what comes next.

## 🔮 What’s Next?

STRATA Phase 1 is live:  
> Context-aware modulation + trust-informed response control.

But we’re already dreaming bigger.  
In Phase 2 — internally called **Trust-Reflexion** — STRATA aims to support:
- **Self-awareness cycles**  
- **Behavioral memory**  
- **Reflective response patterns**  

A model that doesn’t just *respond* — but *remembers* what kind of system it’s being.

## 🧩 3 Core Layers

- **Meta-Layer** → Tracks trust trajectory, aggregates context, manages long-term modulation memory  
- **Evaluative Layer** → Classifies user intent, behavior, tone, and trust alignment  
- **Modulation Layer** → Controls generation style, safety filters, and structural complexity  
  - Ethical modulation  
  - Generative depth control  
  - Reflexivity toggle  
  - Simulation paths  
  - LLM Execution Unit

## 💬 Why It Matters

STRATA is for anyone who’s ever asked:
> “Why did the model suddenly go vague?”  
> “Why was it so reflective last time — and now it's bland?”  
> “Can we *measure* trust, not just guess it?”

We’re building the answer.

## 🤝 Collaborate With Us

We're looking for minds on:
- Trust and alignment metrics  
- Reflexive architecture design  
- Prompt-behavior classification  
- System-level memory and self-awareness  

DMs open. Demos brewing. Let’s modulate trust, together.
