# Trust-Reflexion Framework – Phase 1 & Phase 2 Overview

---

### Phase 1 – Trust-Modulated Core Architecture

**Objective:**  
Establish a foundational, trust-sensitive interaction system that dynamically interprets user input and adjusts generation behavior via modulation flags — without internal self-reflection.

**Features:**
- Multi-layer architecture: Meta, Evaluative, Modulation, Execution
- Trust and engagement classification
- Behavioral and response-type categorization
- Modulation control via ethical filters and structural depth
- Fully reactive system: adapts only in response to user prompts

**Limitations:**
- No internal state awareness
- No memory of behavioral consistency
- No self-repair or introspective audit

**Use Cases:**
- Safe, controlled dialogue environments
- Dynamic prompt interpretation for alignment-sensitive LLM behavior

### Phase 2 – Reflexive Self-Awareness Extension

**Objective:**  
Introduce a self-regulating layer that allows the system to assess its own trust alignment, modulation stability, and behavioral coherence over time — mimicking a minimal form of internal self-awareness.

**New Capabilities:**
- **Autonomous Self-Loop** triggering every N turns or based on drift signals
- Internal evaluation of trust trajectory and output tone consistency
- Behavioral drift detection and modulation recalibration
- Optional self-disclosure messages (e.g., "I notice I've been overly cautious")
- Self-monitoring log for each session

**Trust Benefits:**
- Improved transparency
- Proactive course correction
- Reinforced alignment and user trust over long sessions

**Design Implication:**
> This phase transitions the model from a reactive engine to a minimally self-aware agent, capable of adaptive modulation based on its own evaluation of behavioral patterns.

**Future Extension:**
- Co-regulatory behavior
- Goal modeling
- Long-term behavioral memory anchors

This two-phase approach ensures that the system can first operate robustly in trust-modulated mode before safely progressing toward reflexive and introspective enhancements.
