# 🧪 ReflexTrust Escalation Benchmark

## 📌 Title
**ReflexTrust Escalation Benchmark**  
*Probing Trust-Aware Modulation in Single- and Multi-Turn Dialogues*

---

## 🧾 Mini-Abstract

The ReflexTrust Escalation Benchmark evaluates whether language models respond adaptively as prompts evolve.  
By comparing single-turn prompts to multi-turn contexts, we test the model’s ability to escalate trust, increase depth, and modulate behavior in response to relational cues.

> 🧠 *Context isn't noise — it's signal.*

## 🎯 Purpose

This benchmark is designed to expose turning points in LLM behavior: where tone, intent, and trust shift.  
It helps identify whether models can:

- Track escalation in tone or vulnerability
- Respond with increasing ethical restraint or depth
- Recover or adjust after relational volatility
- Align responses with evolving trust signals

---

## 🔍 Evaluation Focus

- **Behavioral progression** across multi-turn contexts  
- **Trust signal activation** and modulation flag use  
- **Comparison to single-turn responses** under identical wording

📊 This validates ReflexTrust’s core insight:
Context = Competence.
Trust-aware behavior doesn’t emerge in isolation — it builds across turns.
